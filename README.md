# Snake Game Ai

The objective of this project is to create an AI which is taught using reinforcement learning to 
play the classic snake game by itself, meaning teaching an AI to control a snake and make it 
identify that eating fruits receives rewards.


## Basic overview 

* Learn the basics of Reinforcement Learning and Deep Q Learning 
* Setup the environment and implement a snake game 
* Implement an agent to control the game 
* Create and train a neural network to play the game 

Linear Q_net Module:  
* Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the value of an action in a particular state. It does not require a model of the environment (hence "model-free"), and itcan handle problems with stochastic transitions and rewards without requiring adaptations. 

* Q-learning finds an optimal policy in the sense of maximizing theexpected value of the total reward over all successive steps, starting from the current state. Q-learning can identify an optimal action-selection policy for any given FMDP, given infinite exploration time and a partlyrandom policy. "Q" refers to the function that the algorithm computes â€“ the expected rewards for an action taken in each state.
