# Snake Game AI

![Snake Game AI](images/snake_ai_demo.gif)

This project aims to teach an AI to play the classic snake game by utilizing reinforcement learning techniques. The objective is to create an agent that can control a snake in the game, learn to navigate the game board, and recognize the rewards associated with eating fruits.

## Overview

The project covers the following key aspects:

- Understanding the basics of Reinforcement Learning and Deep Q Learning.
- Setting up the game environment and implementing the snake game.
- Developing an agent to control the snake's movements in the game.
- Creating and training a neural network to enable the agent to play the game.

## Linear Q-net Module

The Linear Q-net module forms a crucial part of this project. Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that helps determine the value of an action in a particular state. It does not require a model of the environment and can handle problems with stochastic transitions and rewards without requiring adaptations.

Q-learning finds an optimal policy by maximizing the expected value of the total reward over successive steps, starting from the current state. The "Q" in Q-learning refers to the function that the algorithm computesâ€”the expected rewards for taking an action in each state.
